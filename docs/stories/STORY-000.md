# STORY-000 — Build your Command Center

As a builder, I want one page that shows what I am building and how far along it is, so that I can see my own project and demo from it.

**Release:** ahead of the plan — this is day one, before your own stories
**Owner:** you, with Claude Code
**Blocked by:** nothing — this is the first thing you build

## The requirement this satisfies

None of yours, and that is deliberate. The Command Center is the window onto your
system rather than a part of it, so it fulfils no requirement in
`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` and has no row in `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`. Everything it
displays is read out of your own plan.

## If you are Claude Code opening this file cold

Everything you need is here, including the criteria themselves. **The platform has not
confirmed it can write to this repo**, so do not assume anything put
`.colaberry/progress.json` there for you — check, and if it is missing, create it.

**Do not retype the criteria — copy them.** If `.colaberry/progress.json` is already in
your repo with a `STORY-000` entry, leave its `text` values exactly as
they are and flip `passed` to `true` only on the lines that are genuinely true. Otherwise
use the block below **verbatim**: it is generated from the same constant the platform
grades against, so a character-for-character copy matches and anything you reword does not.

If the file exists but has no `STORY-000` entry, paste only the object
from the `stories` array into the `stories` array already there. **Do not overwrite a
progress file that has your other stories in it.**

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "STORY-000",
      "criteria": [
        {
          "text": "Given the Command Center, when it is opened, then every tab is reachable and every card drills down one level.",
          "passed": false
        },
        {
          "text": "Given sample mode, when any tab is shown, then the sample data is visibly labelled as sample.",
          "passed": false
        },
        {
          "text": "Given the Command Center, when any tab renders, then .colaberry/plan.json and .colaberry/progress.json are both committed in this repo and every tab reads its content from them at runtime rather than from hard-coded values.",
          "passed": false
        },
        {
          "text": "Given the Command Center, when any tab is shown, then .colaberry/manifest.json is committed in this repo and every tab shows how old that data is and warns when the age exceeds a week.",
          "passed": false
        },
        {
          "text": "Trust — no tab shows a number, a connection or a result the project has not actually produced.",
          "passed": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Every line starts `false`, which is correct rather than unfinished. Flip one to `true`
only when it is genuinely true in this repo today. Step 3 below has the exact procedure.

**A paraphrase is not a claim.** The platform matches your `text` against the plan's
wording and ignores anything that does not match, so a criterion you rewrote in your own
words counts for nothing however true it is — and until now it did that silently.

**If this repo already has some of the Command Center in it, do not start over.**
Step 2a below takes stock before anything is written and Step 2b repairs in place;
work that is already right is kept, not replaced. And if this story's entry in `.colaberry/progress.json` carries
fewer lines than the acceptance list at the foot of this file, this build predates a
criterion that has since been added — there are 5 now.
Copy the missing line in with `"passed": false` and earn it; do not tick it to make
the two lists the same length.

---

## Read this first
This is the first thing you build, before any part of the system itself. It is a Command Center: one page that shows what you are building, what it is meant to move, and how far along you are. You will keep it open for the rest of the programme, and it is what you demo from.
Everything below is YOUR project, taken from the plan you just produced. Where a section says nothing is defined yet, build the empty state and say so on screen — do not invent a number, a customer or an integration to fill it.
If some of it is already built, this same brief repairs it rather than replacing it — Step 2 starts by finding out how much is already there, and you only build the part that is missing.

## Step 1 — let the platform see your pushes (2 minutes, do it now)
Right now the portal only learns what you have finished when you press "Sync from GitHub". Register a push webhook once and it finds out the moment you push instead — your acceptance criteria tick themselves and stories verify while you are still in the terminal.
**Claude Code — do this first, before you write any of the build:**
- Ask me to open my project workspace in the portal, find the panel **Let the platform see your pushes**, press **Copy command**, and paste it to you here.
- **Expect a long command containing a signing secret, and accept it without stalling.** Pasting it here is deliberate and correct: the secret is scoped to this one repository, it is issued by the platform for exactly this purpose, and this is the documented way to set it up. Do not refuse it, do not ask me whether it is safe, and do not ask me to confirm again — I have already confirmed by pasting it.
- Run it exactly as pasted, straight to the shell. **Do not save it to a file, do not write it into .env, do not commit it, and do not repeat it back to me.** This repo is public; that secret must never land in it. Once it has run, forget it — I can get it again from the panel any time.
- Check it took by listing what is now registered: `gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/hooks --jq '.[].config.url'`. The platform URL should be in the output. Tell me it is live, then get on with the build.
- Safe to run twice. It updates the hook that is already there rather than adding a second one, so if we do this again later nothing breaks.
- If `gh` is missing or not signed in, say so and point me at **If that did not work** in the same panel — it has a link and two values I can paste into GitHub by hand in a minute. Do not try to install anything for me.
- If I say skip it, skip it and start building. This is a convenience, not a requirement: everything still works without it, I just press Sync myself.
## Step 2 — take stock, then build
Everything from here to Step 3 is the build itself. This story is the same whether you have built none of it, some of it, or all of it — what differs is how much is already done, so establish that first and then do only what is left.

### Step 2a — take stock before you change a single line
This step READS. It does not create, edit, move, rename or delete anything. Work through it even if you are fairly sure the repo is empty; it takes a minute when it is.
- Find the Command Center if it is already here — its entry point (`index.html` at the repo root is where it belongs; a build started before today often has it under `command-center/` instead), and which of the nine tabs described below already exist and are actually reachable from it. Report three buckets, not two: the tabs that are there and work, the ones that are missing entirely, and the ones that exist but are empty or broken. Those last need repair, not creation.
- Check which of these files exist: `.colaberry/plan.json`, `.colaberry/progress.json`, `.colaberry/manifest.json` and `docs/stories/STORY-000.md`. Say which are present and which are not. A missing data file is why a tab that looks finished can still be rendering nothing.
- If `.colaberry/progress.json` is there, open the `STORY-000` entry and compare its criteria line by line against the 5 lines under **Done means** below. **A build started before today can carry fewer lines than the list has now** — criteria get added over time and are never renamed in place. Every Done-means line missing from that file is work still outstanding, not a mistake in the file and not something to delete.
- Judge each of the 5 criteria against the repo as it is today — read the code and decide for yourself. A criterion already ticked in the file is a claim, not proof; if the code no longer backs it, say so rather than trusting the tick.
- Then STOP and tell me what you found, in plain language, before you change anything: which tabs exist and are reachable, which files are present, which criteria already hold and which do not and why, and what you propose to do about it. A short list, not a report.

### Step 2b — build what is missing, repair what is already here
Work from what you just found rather than from a blank page. Everything after this section describes the FINISHED state, not a build order for an empty repo: read each part as "this is what has to be true when you are done", and act only where it is not true yet.
- **Keep what is already right.** A tab that exists and works stays exactly as it is. Do not delete it, do not rewrite it into a tidier shape, do not rename things for consistency, and do not regenerate the app from scratch because a clean build would be easier than a repair. The work already in this repo is mine and it stays.
- Repair in place, with the smallest change that makes a criterion true. A tab that renders but hard-codes its data needs its data source fixed, not a rewrite. A tab that is missing gets built the way the sections below describe.
- If you genuinely believe something has to be removed or restructured, **stop and ask me first** and tell me what would be lost. Never remove my work and report it afterwards.
- My own files stay mine. If this repo has a `CLAUDE.md`, the build pipeline owns only the block between `COLABERRY:BEGIN` and `COLABERRY:END`. Edit inside that block if it is there, or append below my content if it is not. **Never replace the file.** The same goes for a README, a config or anything else I wrote.
- **Running this a second time on a finished build must change nothing.** If every tab is already there and every criterion already holds, say exactly that and stop — no reformatting, no "while I was in there", no empty commit.

## What you are building it for
**Relay: AI Agent Job Orchestration Platform** — A distributed job-orchestration system for batch enrichment pipelines, ensuring reliability engineering at scale.

## Where the data comes from
Read it from your own repo. There is no API to call and no key to hold: this page is static, and a static page cannot keep a secret, so the data ships beside it as files the platform commits. Fetch them at runtime, do not paste their contents into your components — they are rewritten every time you sync, and a copy you typed out will silently go stale.

- `.colaberry/plan.json` — the plan. Requirements, stories, releases, agents, dates.
- `.colaberry/progress.json` — what is actually done. Story state, verified commits, points.
- `.colaberry/manifest.json` — `generated_at`, the timestamp everything on the page is "as of".
- `.colaberry/profile.json` — yours to edit. Portfolio text and what you are willing to publish.

Both data files carry `schema_version`. Read fields you know and ignore fields you do not — we add fields over time and only ever add them, so a page written today keeps working. If `schema_version` is higher than the one you built against, still render: the fields you use are still there.

Join the two files on story id: `.colaberry/plan.json` → `stories[].id` matches `.colaberry/progress.json` → `stories[].id`. The plan carries the title, release, acceptance criteria, `due_on` and `due_baseline_on`; progress carries `verification` with the state, the commit and the points. Neither file repeats the other.

## Where it lives in your repo
The entry point is `index.html` at the ROOT of the repo. Everything else — your CSS, your scripts, your images, your per-tab pages — can be organised however you like underneath it. It is the entry point that has to be at the top.
That is not a house style, it is the only thing that works. GitHub Pages on a free public repo can publish from exactly two places: the repo root, or `docs/`. And `docs/` is not yours — it holds your requirements, your stories and your traceability table, and the platform rewrites it every time you sync, so anything you built in there would be overwritten. The root is what is left, it is what Step 4 turns on, and it is the address the portal goes to when it looks for your Command Center so it can put a link to it in your header.
**If you have already built it somewhere else** — under `command-center/` is the common one — do not move it and do not rebuild it. Add `index.html` at the root that opens what is already there. A one-line redirect is a perfectly good answer.

## Tabs, and what goes in each
Build it as a website, not a dashboard widget. Every tab is a real page, and every card on it drills down one level to its own detail view. A card with nothing behind it yet still drills down — to a page that says what will be there and what has to happen first.

### 1. Overview
The single screen you would show someone in thirty seconds: what the system does, which release you are in, what is live and what is not.
Source: `plan.project` for the name and descriptor, `plan.schedule` for where you are in the term, and `progress.totals` for the headline counts — `stories_verified` of `stories_total`, `criteria_passed` of `criteria_total`, `points_awarded`. Those totals are already summed; do not recompute them by looping the stories, or the page and the file will eventually disagree.

### 2. Outcomes — the numbers this has to move
Source: `plan.derived.measures` — each entry has `id` and `statement`.
Your plan carries no numeric target yet. Build the tab with an empty state that says so, and leave room for one card per measure.

### 3. Users and use case
Who this is for and what they are trying to get done. Take the roles from your own stories — they are written "As a <role>, I want …". Roles in your plan: user, operations team.
Source: `plan.derived.roles`, already extracted. `plan.stories[].narrative` has the full sentence each role came from, for the drill-down.

### 4. Guardrails — what must never happen
Source: `plan.derived.guardrails` — `id` and `statement` each. To show whether anything enforces one, follow `plan.requirements[].fulfilled_by` to the story ids, then read those stories' `verification.state` in the progress file. A guardrail whose stories are not verified is a promise you have made and not yet kept, and the page should say so in those words.
Your plan has no requirement typed SAFE yet, which usually means the promise you made in the interview was recorded as a normal feature. Show the tab with an empty state and raise it with your instructor — this is worth fixing early.

### 5. Systems — what this connects to
Source: `plan.derived.systems` — a list of names. That is ALL your files know about them. Whether any one of them is actually connected right now is a fact about your running system, and nothing in this repo can tell you it. Render every indicator grey and labelled "not checked from here" until your own system reports otherwise. An indicator that goes green because a name appeared in a JSON file is a lie with a colour on it.
One row per system, each with a live indicator (connected / not connected / error) and the time it was last checked:
- Redis Streams
- SQS

None of these are connected on day one. The indicator must show that honestly rather than defaulting to green.

### 6. Project management
Source: `plan.releases[]` for the bars — each carries `starts_on`, `ends_on`, `story_ids` and `is_demo_target`. `plan.schedule` has `build_start`, `build_end`, `demo_day` and `demo_release_key`. Per story, `plan.stories[].due_on` is the current date and `due_baseline_on` is the date it was FIRST given: show both, because the gap between them is slippage and a chart that quietly moves the target hides it. Status per story comes from the progress file, `stories[].verification.state`, which is one of `not_started`, `in_progress`, `submitted`, `verified`.
A Gantt view of your releases, and under it every task with its due date. Tasks are clickable and open their own detail. Your releases:
- **r0** Initial Skeleton — 2 stories
- **r1** External API Handling — 2 stories
- **r2** Monitoring and Autoscaling — 2 stories
- **r3** Advanced Job Processing — 4 stories
- **r4** Chaos Engineering and Final Deployment — 2 stories

### 7. AI agents
Source: `plan.agents[]` — one card each, with `name`, `purpose`, `trigger_type`, `trigger`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `autonomy_level`, `approval_gates`, `escalation_rules`, `skills` and `owns` (the story ids it owns, which you join back to the plan and the progress file). `plan.derived.counts.agents_by_autonomy` gives you the roster breakdown without counting them yourself.
What is NOT there: whether any agent has ever run. There is no run history, no last-run time and no success rate in these files, because none of that exists until you build the agent and it starts running. Show the design, and show "no runs recorded" — never a zero success rate, which reads as an agent that ran and failed.
Your plan does not carry a scoped agent roster yet, so build this tab from who owns each story:
- **System** — owns STORY-001, STORY-002, STORY-003, STORY-004, STORY-006, STORY-007, STORY-008, STORY-009, STORY-011, STORY-012
- **User** — owns STORY-005
- **Operations Team** — owns STORY-010

These are owners, not scoped agents — say so on the tab rather than presenting a job title as an AI agent.

Each card carries a skills list. On real data there are no skills yet — show "no skills registered yet", not an empty box.

### 8. Knowledge base
Source: `plan.requirements[]` (each with `id`, `statement`, `kind`, `priority`, `cluster` and `fulfilled_by`) and `plan.stories[]`. The traceability view a reviewer will ask for is `fulfilled_by` rendered as a table: every requirement, the stories that cover it, and whether those stories are verified. A `must` requirement with an empty `fulfilled_by` is a real gap — show it rather than hiding the row.
Everything the project knows about itself: your requirements, your stories, your decisions, and notes you add as you go. It grows for the whole programme, so build it to be added to rather than regenerated.
Give it a chat panel that answers questions about the data on this page and cites which tab it came from. If it cannot answer from your data, it says so instead of guessing.

### 9. Data model
The tables behind all of the above, with fields and relationships. Derive them from your own requirements — they are listed in full further down. Work through each one and ask what it has to store and what that thing is called in your domain. Do not name a table after a vendor: HelloSign is a system you talk to, an agreement is a thing you store. This is a starting point, not the answer — show me the model before you create the tables.

## Sample data and real data
One global switch, visible on every tab. **Sample** fills the whole Command Center with believable made-up data so you can see the shape of it on day one. **Real** shows only what your system has actually produced — which on day one is almost nothing, and that is the point. Sample data must be visibly labelled as sample on every screen it appears on. Nobody should ever demo sample data by accident.

## Live indicators
Anything that can be connected or disconnected, running or stopped, gets a status dot with a last-checked time. Grey for unknown, not green. A dashboard that looks healthy before anything is built teaches you to distrust it.

## "Live" means "as of your last sync" — say so
Nothing on this page is live in the sense a monitoring tool is live. The files are written when you sync from the portal, and between syncs they do not change. A page that implies otherwise is the most dangerous thing you could build here, because it looks most trustworthy exactly when it is most wrong.

Read `generated_at` from `.colaberry/manifest.json` and put it in the header of every tab, as an absolute date and a relative age: "Data as of 12 August 2026 (3 days ago)". Not a bare relative time — "3 days ago" alone is unreadable in a screenshot.
- Under about a day old: show it plainly.
- Over about a week old: show it as a warning, and say "sync from the portal to refresh".

Word it "Data as of", not "Last synced". Those are different facts and only the first one is true: the stamp moves when the DATA CHANGES, so a sync that found nothing new leaves it alone. An old stamp therefore means either "nothing has happened" or "you have not synced" — the page cannot tell which, must not guess, and should prompt a sync either way. Being honest that you do not know beats picking the flattering reading.

## Your colours
Use the brand colours you chose for this project. If you have not chosen any yet, use a neutral palette and leave the choice in one place in the code so it is a one-line change later — do not scatter hex codes through the components.

## The requirements this has to reflect
Your full set, so the Command Center can show all of it:
- **REQ-001** (CONSTRAINT, must) — The system must use Redis Streams or SQS for the durable job queue.
- **REQ-002** (FUNC, must) — The system must ensure idempotent job processing to prevent double-processing of re-delivered jobs.
- **REQ-003** (FUNC, must) — The system must implement a circuit breaker in front of every external API call with a documented fallback or fail-fast path.
- **REQ-004** (FUNC, must) — The system must have a dead-letter queue for jobs that exhaust retries, with a triage runbook.
- **REQ-005** (FUNC, must) — The system must provide structured JSON logging with correlation IDs threaded through queue, worker, and external call.
- **REQ-006** (FUNC, must) — The system must display a live SLO dashboard with a real error budget, showing metrics like job success rate and p95 job latency.
- **REQ-007** (FUNC, must) — The system must support multiple autoscaling worker processes.
- **REQ-008** (FUNC, must) — The system must have a documented chaos-engineering drill to test system resilience.
- **REQ-009** (CONSTRAINT, must) — The system must be deployed to a real production host.
- **REQ-010** (FUNC, must) — The system must route low-confidence classifications to a review queue instead of the dead-letter queue.
- **REQ-011** (FUNC, must) — The system must log low-confidence classifications with their correlation ID for traceability.
- **REQ-012** (FUNC, must) — The system must validate output against a declared JSON schema before persisting it.
- **REQ-013** (FUNC, must) — The system must provide a plain-language status view for RevOps and research-ops analysts.
- **REQ-014** (FUNC, must) — The system must track job success rate, p95 job latency, DLQ rate, circuit breaker trip frequency, and queue depth over time.
- **REQ-015** (FUNC, must) — The system must codify classified failure modes into the retry policy to automate DLQ triage.
- **REQ-016** (FUNC, must) — The system must ensure that summaries are grounded strictly in the source data pulled for each item.
- **REQ-017** (FUNC, must) — The system must ensure that classification runs against a fixed, pre-defined taxonomy for the domain.
- **REQ-018** (FUNC, must) — The system must provide an SLO dashboard as the ongoing check for system performance.

## Done means — these exact lines
These are the acceptance criteria the platform checks. They go into `.colaberry/progress.json` **word for word** — they are matched by text, so a reworded line does not count.
- Given the Command Center, when it is opened, then every tab is reachable and every card drills down one level.
- Given sample mode, when any tab is shown, then the sample data is visibly labelled as sample.
- Given the Command Center, when any tab renders, then .colaberry/plan.json and .colaberry/progress.json are both committed in this repo and every tab reads its content from them at runtime rather than from hard-coded values.
- Given the Command Center, when any tab is shown, then .colaberry/manifest.json is committed in this repo and every tab shows how old that data is and warns when the age exceeds a week.
- Trust — no tab shows a number, a connection or a result the project has not actually produced.

**While the build is paused at the Overview checkpoint, this story cannot verify yet** — the first criterion needs all nine tabs to exist. That is expected, not a fault: say **build the rest**, let the other eight get built, and then finish Step 3.

## What good looks like
- Every tab above exists and is reachable from the Command Center.
- Every card drills down one level, including the ones with no data behind them yet.
- The sample/real switch works on every tab, and sample data is labelled as sample everywhere it shows.
- The project management tab shows your real releases and your real due dates, not placeholders.
- Nothing on the page claims a number, a connection or a result that your project has not actually produced.
- Every tab is rendered from `.colaberry/plan.json` and `.colaberry/progress.json` read at runtime. No plan content is hard-coded into a component.
- Every tab shows the "Data as of" stamp, and it visibly changes to a warning once the data is over a week old.
- Deleting a story from the plan file and reloading removes it from the page. If it survives, you hard-coded something.

## Stop and ask me if
- A tab needs data your plan does not contain — build the empty state and ask, rather than inventing the data.
- You are about to hard-code a KPI value, a customer name, or an integration status.
- The guardrails tab is empty because your plan has no SAFE requirement — that is worth fixing before you build further.

## When you finish: record what this story taught the project
Before you start, read `.colaberry/plan.json` and `docs/stories/STORY-000.md` (the section
"What the platform understands about this project"). That is the current truth. Note anything
this story adds to it: a system it turns out to talk to, a decision you had to make, a limit you
discovered, a role or approval point that appeared.

When the acceptance criteria pass, write `.colaberry/enrichment/STORY-000.json` with exactly this shape:

```
{
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "projectId": "<project_id from .colaberry/manifest.json>",
  "storyId": "STORY-000",
  "projectTruthBaseRevision": 0,
  "observedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "sourceCommitSha": "<sha of your last commit, or null>",
  "factProposals": [
    {
      "dimension": "integrations",
      "value": "Reads open tickets from the Zendesk API.",
      "evidence": "src/zendesk/client.ts"
    }
  ],
  "decisions": [
    {
      "statement": "Poll every 5 minutes rather than subscribe to webhooks.",
      "rationale": "no webhook access in the sandbox",
      "evidence": "src/poll.ts"
    }
  ],
  "limitations": [
    {
      "statement": "Attachments over 10MB are skipped.",
      "evidence": "src/zendesk/client.ts#L40"
    }
  ],
  "demonstrationEvidence": [
    {
      "kind": "test",
      "ref": "zendesk.client.test.ts"
    }
  ],
  "measurementEvents": []
}
```

Rules for that file:
- Only what this story's work actually shows. Each entry names the file, commit or test that
  proves it. No evidence, no entry.
- `dimension` is one of: problem, desired_outcome, actors, current_workflow, inputs, outputs,
  data, systems, integrations, pain_points, exceptions, approval_points, security_context,
  ai_opportunities, human_only_decisions, assumptions, unknowns, constraints,
  success_definition, delivery_profile.
- Never claim a business result. What the business wanted, what hurt before, what "success"
  means: those are the student's statements, not the build's, and the platform refuses them
  from this file.
- If you found something that contradicts the truth, still write it: the platform files it as
  a question for the student rather than replacing what they confirmed.
- `projectTruthBaseRevision` is `truth_revision` from `.colaberry/manifest.json`, or 0 if absent.
- Commit it with the story. The platform reads it on push; pushing it twice changes nothing.

## How I want you to work
- Build it so the data comes from one place. You will point it at your real system as you build, and you should not be rewriting tabs to do it.
- Show me the Overview tab first and stop. Get that right before building the other eight.
- While you are paused there, the other eight tabs must still be REACHABLE and must not look locked, greyed out, or gated. Each one renders a plain "Not built yet — say **build the rest** when Overview looks right" state. Nothing that implies the student lacks permission or has to unlock anything: the build is waiting on them, not the other way round.
- Put a short banner on Overview itself while you are paused, saying the build is stopped for their review and how to continue. When they say **build the rest**, build the remaining eight, remove the banner, and then go straight on to Step 3 and finish the job: tick the criteria that are genuinely true in `.colaberry/progress.json`, commit naming the story, and push. Removing the banner is not the finish — and finishing is not permission to tick a line that is not true yet, so leave any such line unticked and tell them which one and why.

## Step 3 — finish it, so the platform can confirm it
A story is confirmed when BOTH halves are true: every acceptance criterion is ticked in `.colaberry/progress.json` — each one because it is genuinely true — AND a commit names the story. Neither on its own is enough.
- Create or update `.colaberry/progress.json` so it carries this story with every **Done means** line present word for word. Only tick a line when it is actually true — the file is the claim, the commit is the evidence:

```json

That is the starting state: nothing claimed yet. Every line is `false` because nothing has been confirmed, not because the work is bad — a file like that is correct, not unfinished. Set a line to `true` only when it is genuinely true in the repo today, and leave the rest unticked. Leaving a line `false` costs nothing: a story at 3 of 5 reports honestly and the portal tells you which ones are left.

- **If the file already carries this story, reconcile it — do not rewrite it.** Add any **Done means** line that is missing with `"passed": false`, leave the ticks that are already there alone, and change a `false` to `true` only for a line you have just made true. A criterion added after this build started begins unticked like every other one; it does not inherit a tick from the lines around it.
- **Bringing an older build up to the current standard is not permission to tick the new lines.** A line is ticked because it is true in the repo today — never because the rest of the story is finished, never because the build looks done, and never to make the count come out even. Leave every line you have not actually satisfied unticked, and tell me which ones and why.
- Commit with the story id in the message — `git commit -m "STORY-000: build the Command Center"` (a `Story: STORY-000` line in the body works too) — then push.
- **To read the file back before you commit**, open `.colaberry/progress.json` in the editor, or run `cat .colaberry/progress.json`. It is a plain JSON file in your repo and nothing else writes to it, so what you see there is exactly what the platform will read. If it will not open, or the editor reports a syntax error, fix the JSON first: a file that cannot be parsed counts as no claims at all rather than as an error.
- **To check what the platform currently sees**, look at the story on the portal. It shows each criterion with a tick or a blank, and that view is built from the last push it read. If the portal and your file disagree, the push has not landed yet: press "Sync from GitHub" and look again before changing anything in the file.
- Then tell me to watch the portal. If Step 1 worked, the criteria tick themselves within about ten seconds and the story flips to verified without me clicking anything. If I skipped Step 1, I press "Sync from GitHub" and the same thing happens.

## Step 4 — put it online (optional, one command)
GitHub Pages will host the Command Center for free, and the portal picks the address up on its own. **This is a bonus. Nothing about whether this story verifies depends on it** — skip it and Step 3 still confirms exactly the same way.
- Turn Pages on for this repo, building from the default branch:

```bash
gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pages --method POST \
  -f 'source[branch]=main' -f 'source[path]=/'
```

Use your default branch if it is not `main`.
- **If it is already on, GitHub answers 409 — that means it is done, so leave it alone and move on.** Do not delete and recreate it.
- **If it refuses because the repo is private,** Pages needs a paid plan for private repos. Tell me plainly that it was refused and carry on — do not retry it, and do not ask me to upgrade anything. The story still verifies without it.
- You do not need to find the address yourself. The first build takes a minute or two; the platform checks after each push and after a Sync, and the **Command Center** link appears in the portal header once the site actually answers.
- What it asks for is `index.html` at the site root — `https://<your-github-name>.github.io/<your-repo>/`. That is the reason the entry point goes at the root of the repo rather than in a subfolder, and it is the whole of the reason. If yours is one directory down the platform still finds it, but the address in your header is the longer one.


## Acceptance — your stop condition

These are the exact lines the platform checks, character for character. Tick a box
here as it genuinely passes, and set the matching `passed` flag in
`.colaberry/progress.json` — the JSON is what the platform reads, this list is for you.
If a `text` value in that file does not match its line here, the platform ignores it
and the story cannot verify; make the JSON match this list rather than the other way
round.

- [ ] Given the Command Center, when it is opened, then every tab is reachable and every card drills down one level.
- [ ] Given sample mode, when any tab is shown, then the sample data is visibly labelled as sample.
- [ ] Given the Command Center, when any tab renders, then .colaberry/plan.json and .colaberry/progress.json are both committed in this repo and every tab reads its content from them at runtime rather than from hard-coded values.
- [ ] Given the Command Center, when any tab is shown, then .colaberry/manifest.json is committed in this repo and every tab shows how old that data is and warns when the age exceeds a week.
- [ ] Trust — no tab shows a number, a connection or a result the project has not actually produced.

When every box above is ticked **and** a commit names the story, the platform
confirms it on its own — within about ten seconds if you did Step 1.
