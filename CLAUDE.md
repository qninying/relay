# CLAUDE.md — Relay: AI Agent Job Orchestration Platform

Conventions for this build. Claude Code reads this automatically.

## What this is

A distributed job-orchestration system for batch enrichment pipelines, ensuring reliability engineering at scale.

## Where the truth lives

- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — what the system must do
- `docs/STORIES.md` — the work, by release
- `docs/stories/STORY-nnn.md` — one story in full, with its acceptance criteria
- `docs/TRACEABILITY.md` — which story covers which requirement

Read the requirement before writing code for a story. If the requirement is wrong,
fix the requirement — you are the architect here, not a typist.

## How we build

- **Walking skeleton first.** Get the thinnest end-to-end path working, including the
  audit trail and whatever correctness guarantee this system promises, before stacking features.
- **Small, reversible steps.** A change you cannot undo in one command is too big.
- **Every external call gets an explicit timeout and capped retries.** No unbounded waits.
- **Every side effect is idempotent.** Running it twice must not double-charge, double-email,
  or double-create. If a retry can produce a duplicate, it is broken.
- **Never swallow an error.** An empty `catch` block is a defect, not tidiness.

## Definition of done

A story is done when **every** acceptance criterion on it passes **and** a commit
names it. Both halves. All of the criteria, not the important ones; and the work in
git, not just ticked off.

1. Tests cover the happy path **and** at least one failure path.
2. No secrets in code, commits, or logs.
3. Every acceptance criterion in `docs/stories/STORY-nnn.md` genuinely passes.

## When you finish a story

Two steps, in this order. The platform reads both — skip either and the story stays
unverified, and it will tell you which half is missing.

1. Update `.colaberry/progress.json`: find the story by `id`, set `passed` on each
   criterion to what is actually true, and fill in `files_touched` and `tests_added`.
   Leave the ones that do not pass as `false` — a partly finished story is a real,
   expected state and reports honestly. Do not add criteria of your own: only the ones
   from the plan are counted, and invented ones are discarded.
2. Commit, naming the story in a trailer, e.g. `STORY-001: add the roster endpoint`
   with `Story: STORY-001` on its own line below. The commit must change at least one
   file. Then push — the platform reads pushed commits, not your working tree.

## The `.colaberry/` files

These three files are what your Command Center reads, so they have to be in your repo.

- `.colaberry/plan.json` — your requirements, stories and releases. **The plan only.**
  It carries no completion state: there is no `built` on a requirement and no
  `status` on a story, in any version.
- `.colaberry/progress.json` — the criteria, which of them you have confirmed, and
  the story state. **Completion comes from here**, via `stories[].verification.state`.
- `.colaberry/manifest.json` — when the data above was last refreshed.

See `docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md` for the field-by-field spec of all three, the
join on story id, and a worked example. Read it before you write anything that
renders them — guessing at these shapes is the single most common way a Command
Center ends up showing numbers that are not true.

Where the platform has push access to this repo it writes all three for you on every
sync. It always refreshes `manifest.json`. It refreshes `plan.json` only while that file
is still exactly as the platform last wrote it: **edit `plan.json` by hand and the
platform will notice and stop overwriting it** — your version stays, and later plan
changes stop arriving in it, so from then on it is yours to maintain. (It compares your
copy against the hash in `manifest.json`, and it leaves the file alone whenever it cannot
prove the copy is one it wrote.) **Where it does not have push access it
cannot put them there at all**, and they are yours to add: download them from the
workspace panel in the portal and commit them like any other file. Either way, a
criterion that names one of these files is not satisfied until the file is really in
your repo.

`.colaberry/progress.json` is shared in both cases: the platform owns the story and
criterion list in it, you own the `passed` flags and the notes, and a sync keeps your
side. Everything else — including the docs above — is yours to change.
